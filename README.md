# Nmap Security Scanner - Vulnerability Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes **Nmap** (Network Mapper) to scan a target network or system for open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to analyze the security posture of the system and suggest remediation strategies.

## Features
- Performs deep network scanning using Nmap
- Detects open ports and running services
- Identifies security vulnerabilities using NSE scripts
- Generates detailed scan reports
- Provides security recommendations

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Nmap** installed on your system:

#### Linux / macOS:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap  # Debian-based
sudo dnf install nmap  # Fedora-based
brew install nmap      # macOS
```

#### Windows:
Download and install Nmap from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html).

## Usage
### 1. Basic Port Scan
```bash
nmap <target-ip>
```

### 2. Scan for Vulnerabilities
```bash
nmap --script=vuln <target-ip>
```

### 3. Perform a Full Scan and Save Results
```bash
nmap -A -p- -oN scan_results.txt <target-ip>
```

### 4. Scan Multiple Hosts
```bash
nmap -iL targets.txt -oN scan_results.txt
```

## Interpreting Results
- **Open Ports**: Services running on the system
- **Service Detection**: Identifies running software
- **Vulnerabilities**: Lists potential security risks

## Security Recommendations
- Close unnecessary ports
- Update outdated software/services
- Implement firewalls and access controls
- Regularly monitor network activity

## Reporting Issues
If you find a vulnerability, report it responsibly to the system owner or administrator.
